# The Confetti Mod
The Confetti mod is a fun and colorful mod for Minecraft that spices up your gameplay by turning totem particles into neat confetti with a bunch of random colors.

## News
Confetti has been updated to 1.19! I've made JARs for every 1.19 subversion, and I will be making branches for each subversion. In the future to prevent clutter, I will remove these branches and I will make a pull request and update the main branch to 1.19. Currently this is not possible because I haven't yet downported the mod to 1.17 and 1.16. As a further point, my goal is going to be adding support only until 1.16. Most cpvpers play on the newer versions (and so do regular players) as there is no reason to stay on the older versions besides FPS reasons, but due to most servers which used to be on versions 1.14-1.16 updating to the new versions (1.19=1.20), most players have migrated from those versions to 1.19-1.20. Those who couldn't run the newer versions would've at least moved to 1.18 and *its* sub-versions because of the new height changes made in 1.18 onward. I may not consider downporting the mod below 1.17 at all because of this, and 1.18.x as well as the 1.19 sub-versions are enough on their own. I am simply only one developer working on this mod, and although it's very simple, it's still a pain to update every Jar for each version of Minecraft.

## Installation
To install the Confetti Mod, you can visit my [Modrinth Page](https://modrinth.com/mod/confetti) to download a version. Currently, this mod only supports 1.18.2. Download the jar file from Modrinth, then add the downloaded jar into your mods folder (usually at %appdata%/.minecraft/mods), then launch minecraft and enjoy the confetti!

## Usage
Once the Confetti Mod is installed, you will see that totem particles are now randomly colored and look like fun confetti. They will all be assigned a random color, adding a fun and festive touch to your experience!

## Compatibility
Currently, the Confetti Mod is only compatible with Minecraft version 1.18.2, but I am planning to add support for versions ranging from 1.14 all the way up to 1.20. I will not be able to do this on my own though, and I appreciate any and all [contributions](https://github.com/SummerNugget/confetti-mod/blob/main/README.md#contribution) to this mod.

## Credits
The Confetti Mod was created by me, but couldn't be made without the help of the great Fabric community. You can join their Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/DHd2xYcSxr). Thank you for downloading and using my little mod! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me on GitHub or Discord (TimeSquared#9292).

## Contribution
Anyone can contribute to this mod with anything. I currently have a [Trello list](https://trello.com/b/9zHUWJaO/confetti-mod) containing all the features I want to add in the future, and to contribute all you need to do is create a fork of this repository and then add your changes, and then submit a pull request. I will review all pull requests and will accept them as long as they don't break anything or add any malicious content. Thank you in advance if you decided to contribute!

## Building the Mod from Source Code
To build your own version of Confetti, all you need to do is type in ./gradlew build into your terminal. I will not be posting a full tutorial on how to build this source code as a project for either IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, and I will be assuming that if you're visiting this GitHub page then you already know how and intend to contribute to this mod.

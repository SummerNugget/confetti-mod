# The Confetti Mod
The Confetti mod is a fun and colorful mod for Minecraft that spices up your gameplay by turning totem particles into neat confetti with a bunch of random colors.

## Installation
To install the Confetti Mod, you can visit my [Modrinth Page](https://modrinth.com/mod/confetti) to download a version. Currently, this mod only supports 1.18.2. Download the jar file from Modrinth, then add the downloaded jar into your mods folder (usually at %appdata%/.minecraft/mods), then launch minecraft and enjoy the confetti!

## Usage
Once the Confetti Mod is installed, you will see that totem particles are now randomly colored and look like fun confetti. They will all be assigned a random color, adding a fun and festive touch to your experience!

## Compatibility
Currently, the Confetti Mod is only compatible with Minecraft version 1.18.2, but I am planning to add support for versions ranging from 1.14 all the way up to 1.20. I will not be able to do this on my own though, and I appreciate any and all [contributions](https://github.com/SummerNugget/confetti-mod/blob/main/README.md#contribution) to this mod.

## Credits
The Confetti Mod was created by me, but couldn't be made without the help of the great Fabric community. You can join their Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/DHd2xYcSxr). Thank you for downloading and using my little mod! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me on GitHub or Discord (TimeSquared#9292).

## License
This mod is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/). Feel free to edit and modify this mod as you wish, but please give credits to me when you do so.

## Contribution
Anyone can contribute to this mod with anything. I currently have a [Trello list](https://trello.com/b/9zHUWJaO/confetti-mod) containing all the features I want to add in the future, and to contribute all you need to do is create a fork of this repository and then add your changes, and then submit a pull request. I will review all pull requests and will accept them as long as they don't break anything or add any malicious content. Thank you in advance if you decided to contribute!

## Building the Mod from Source Code
To build your own version of Confetti, all you need to do is type in ./gradlew build into your terminal. I will not be posting a full tutorial on how to build this source code as a project for either IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, and I will be assuming that if you're visiting this GitHub page then you already know how and intend to contribute to this mod.
